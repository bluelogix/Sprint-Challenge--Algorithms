<!--Exercise 1 -->
a. O(n)
b. O(n^3)
c. O(n)

<!-- Exercise 2 -->

a. First check what story you're in. Next drop the egg from that story, if it breaks then the story is too high and should now do story minus 1. In a loop that will keep checking if the story is too high.
I think this would be O(n) or O(2^n)
